### 1. Metrop is politically neutral

All content and translations must remain politically neutral.

#### 1.1. Belonging of a place to a country or legitimacy of a country

In cases of disputes regarding territorial belonging, the affiliation of a place to a country or the legitimacy of a country must be based on international consensus, such as United Nations recognition (e.g. Kosovo), or on a complete, objective, and well-documented autonomous status of the territory (e.g. Taiwan, but only for the territory of the island of Taiwan).

You may add a note to clarify the nature of the authorities or the political status of a territory when it is subject to a dispute.

#### 1.2. Neutral naming conventions

Place names must use internationally recognized and commonly accepted names.  
The name used must be consistent with the language of the quiz.

You may use either:
- the name of the place in the language of the quiz, or
- the local (native) name of the place.

However, mixing languages is not allowed.

Examples:
- English quiz: *Germany* or *Deutschland*
- French quiz: *Allemagne* or *Deutschland*
- Incorrect usage: *Germany* in a French quiz

#### 1.3. No political opinions or advocacy

All content must remain strictly neutral. Contributors must avoid expressing political opinions, supporting any political ideology, party, movement, or government, or implying any preference in disputed matters.

#### 1.4. Historical and geographical accuracy

All content must be factually correct, verifiable, and based on reliable sources. This applies to both historical and geographical information.

#### 1.5. Respectful and neutral language

All content must use clear, respectful, and neutral language. Avoid any wording that could be seen as judgmental, biased, or emotionally charged, and ensure that questions, answers, and explanations are phrased factually and objectively.

#### 1.6. Consistency across quizzes and translations

The same rules of neutrality, accuracy, and clarity must apply to both quizzes and their translations. Translations should faithfully preserve the meaning of the original content without introducing bias, altering political context, or changing geographical or historical information.

### 2. No sensitive content

All content must be suitable for all audiences. Quizzes, translations, and images must not include any material that could be considered harmful, offensive, or inappropriate. The content should focus on factual, educational, and neutral information to ensure a safe and respectful experience for all users.

#### 2.1. Violent or dangerous content

Avoid content that depicts or encourages violence, self-harm, dangerous behavior, or illegal activities. This applies to both text and images, including illustrations, diagrams, or any visual content.

#### 2.2. Sexual or explicit content

Do not include sexually explicit material, pornography, or suggestive content in quizzes, translations, or images. All visual and textual content must remain appropriate for general audiences.

#### 2.3. Shocking, offensive, or discriminatory content

Content that is excessively graphic, gory, disturbing, or offensive must be avoided. Do not include material that discriminates or targets individuals or groups based on race, religion, gender, nationality, disability, or any other personal characteristic.

### 3. Non-compliance with these rules

Metrop strictly does not tolerate any content that violates these rules. Contributors must respect all guidelines to ensure the platform remains neutral, safe, and reliable.

#### 3.1. Content verification and approval

All content added through contributions is reviewed and approved. However, since Metrop is open source and users can add or create their own files, full compliance cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, any content that does not follow these rules is not validated or endorsed by Metrop.

#### 3.2. Contact in case of issues

If an error or issue is found in the official Metrop, you can contact the creators to resolve the problem.
