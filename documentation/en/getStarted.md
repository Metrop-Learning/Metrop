## FAQ:

### Metrop currently operates as a static website to be compatible with GitHub Pages. Is it possible for Metrop to evolve into a dynamic website in the future?

**Yes**, it is our objective to move to a client–server architecture, but currently we can’t afford the cost of a server or the time needed to develop the server-side application.

### Will Metrop receive a mobile app?

**Yes**, we are planning to create an Android app.
